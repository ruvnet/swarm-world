## Upgrade Guide

### From 1.1.x to 1.2.x

**Breaking Changes:**
- `SwarmController` renamed to `SwarmManager`
- Behavior weight properties moved to individual behavior components

**Migration Steps:**
```csharp
// Old (1.1.x)
SwarmController controller = GetComponent<SwarmController>();
controller.separationWeight = 2f;

// New (1.2.x)
SwarmManager manager = GetComponent<SwarmManager>();
var flocking = manager.GetBehavior<FlockingBehavior>();
flocking.SeparationWeight = 2f;
```

### From 1.0.x to 1.1.x

**API Changes:**
- Spatial partitioning is now enabled by default
- Performance settings moved to dedicated component

**Migration Steps:**
```csharp
// Add performance component for fine-tuning
gameObject.AddComponent<SwarmPerformanceManager>();
```
