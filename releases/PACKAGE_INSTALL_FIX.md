# Package Installation Fix - Unity Swarm AI v1.0.0

## 🔧 **Fixed Installation Issue**

**Problem**: Unity Package Manager couldn't find `package.json` in the compressed archive.
**Solution**: Restructured package with `package.json` at root level.

## 📦 **Corrected Installation Methods**

### **Method 1: Unity Package Manager - Git URL (Recommended)**
```
1. Window > Package Manager
2. '+' → "Add package from git URL"
3. Enter: https://github.com/ruvnet/swarm-world.git?path=/UnitySwarmAI
4. Click "Add"
```

### **Method 2: Download .tgz Package (FIXED)**
```
1. Download: unity-swarm-ai-v1.0.0.tgz
2. Window > Package Manager
3. '+' → "Add package from tarball"
4. Select the downloaded .tgz file
5. Unity will import automatically
```

### **Method 3: Download .zip Package (Manual)**
```
1. Download: unity-swarm-ai-v1.0.0.zip  
2. Extract to temporary folder
3. Copy extracted contents to: YourProject/Packages/com.claudeflow.unity-swarm-ai/
4. Unity will detect and import
```

### **Method 4: Local Package Manager**
```
1. Download and extract either package
2. Window > Package Manager
3. '+' → "Add package from disk"
4. Navigate to extracted folder and select package.json
```

## ✅ **Package Structure (Fixed)**

**Before (Broken)**:
```
unity-swarm-ai-v1.0.0.tgz
└── unity-swarm-ai-v1.0.0/
    └── package.json  ← Unity couldn't find this
```

**After (Working)**:
```
unity-swarm-ai-v1.0.0.tgz
├── package.json      ← Now at root level ✅
├── Runtime/
├── Editor/
├── Examples/
└── Documentation/
```

## 🚀 **Quick Verification**

After installation:
1. Check Package Manager shows "Unity Swarm AI" 
2. Import "Basic Flocking Demo" sample
3. Open sample scene and press Play
4. Verify agents are flocking smoothly

## 📋 **Troubleshooting**

**Still having issues?**
- Try Method 1 (Git URL) - most reliable
- Ensure Unity 2021.3+ is being used
- Clear Package Manager cache: Delete `Library/PackageCache/`
- Restart Unity after installation
