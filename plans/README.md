## ðŸ“Š Research Summary

The Unity ecosystem offers robust solutions for implementing swarm AI, from simple flocking behaviors to complex multi-agent systems. The key is choosing the right tool for your specific requirements:

- **Performance needs** (agent count)
- **Team expertise** (MonoBehaviour vs ECS)
- **Budget constraints**
- **Platform targets** (mobile vs PC/console)

Modern trends show a shift toward ECS/DOTS for performance and GPU compute for massive scale. The integration of machine learning (ML-Agents) is opening new possibilities for emergent behaviors.
