## Introduction to Swarm AI in Unity {#introduction}

Swarm AI refers to collective intelligence systems where simple agents follow local rules to produce complex emergent behaviors. In Unity, this includes:

- **Flocking/Boids**: Birds, fish, or crowd movements
- **Ant Colony Optimization**: Pathfinding and resource gathering
- **Particle Swarm Optimization**: Problem-solving algorithms
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinated autonomous agents

### Core Principles

1. **Emergence**: Complex behaviors from simple rules
2. **Decentralization**: No central control authority
3. **Self-Organization**: Agents organize without external guidance
4. **Local Interaction**: Decisions based on nearby agents only

5. **Debug Visualization**: Essential for tuning behaviors

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Over-using Unity's physics system
- Not implementing spatial partitioning
- Ignoring mobile/console constraints
- Complex behaviors without profiling
- Tight coupling between systems

## Conclusion

Unity offers a rich ecosystem for implementing swarm AI, from simple Asset Store plugins to sophisticated custom solutions. The key is choosing the right approach for your specific requirements regarding scale, performance, and complexity.

For most projects, starting with an established plugin and customizing as needed provides the best balance of development speed and flexibility. As requirements grow, transitioning to ECS or GPU-based solutions ensures scalability.
